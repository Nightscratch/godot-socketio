# Godot Socket.IO

This is a rudimentary implementation of a Socket.IO client in GDScript. Currently it is meant to serve more as a proof-of-concept than as a completed library. 
It has not been extensively tested and is missing plenty of features.

## Missing Features

* Disconnect handling and auto-reconnection
* Support for binary data
* Various API methods like `onAny`, `once`, `off`, `timeout`, etc
* Support for old protocol versions
